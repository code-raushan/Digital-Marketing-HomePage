# Digital Marketing HomePage
<br>

**Hi everyone, I am Raushan KumarðŸ˜ƒ.**

>This project is a landing page of a digital marketing agencyðŸ’». This particular project used `flexbox` and some concepts of `positions` extensively.

- This is really a good project to learn building good looking and interactive landing pagesðŸ˜‰. Especially the font and color combination used make it look even better and professionalðŸ˜Ž.

- Key learning are follows:
    - designing good looking and interactive navbars
    - aligning content with an image
    - using positions for footer button


Below is the link and the view of the pageðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡<br>
